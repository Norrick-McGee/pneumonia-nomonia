Sequential Keras Network to predict pneumonia from Chest Xrays


This projecet I used X-ray data from https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia

The main goal of this project was to get experience setting up a simple Nueral Network outside of the MNIST dataset. 

I was able to reach a train Acc of 94%
and my Val_acc was 79%
